# Project 3 - PlanIt


This project was created within a week for a class project using the React front-end framework. 

This public repository is for the administration of PlanIt, our final project. The core framework the group used is React. The purpose of this application is for a user to login and crete events / activies to render an itinerary. It is meant to be collaborative amongst your friends, or whomever you are travelling with! You can "Like" an event / activity and also leave a comment.
